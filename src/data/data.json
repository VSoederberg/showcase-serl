These blocks span the entire development lifecycle: from model training and fine-tuning, through product evaluation, to building and running AI agents in production. Beyond definition, we are building providers for the Llama Stack APIs. These were developing open-source versions and partnering with providers, ensuring developers can assemble AI solutions using consistent, interlocking pieces across platforms. The ultimate goal is to accelerate innovation in the AI space.\n\nThe Stack APIs are rapidly improving, but still very much work in progress and we invite feedback as well as direct contributions.",
